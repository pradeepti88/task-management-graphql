# Task Management Application - Using React, MaterialUI, Node, Graphql, MongoDB, Apollo Sever, Apollo Client, Jest

This is a simple single page application developed to display tasks which are fetched from MongoDB using GraphQL API's. CURD operations can be performed from the frontend which are again driven by using graphQL API's.

This application codebase has two folders

- client/task-management : This folder contains the frontend codebase (React + GraphQL using Apollo Client)
- server : This folder contains the backend codebase (NodeJS + GraphQL using Apollo Server)

README files of individual folders have more information on how to install and test
